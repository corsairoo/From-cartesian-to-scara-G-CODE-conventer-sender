# From-cartesian-to-scara-G-CODE-conventer-sender

Change cartesian to scara (still have some problems with calculation) and send to arduino.
At now works only for 'reduced' comands (only simple moves, anything else can cause error).

Code still needs much work, especially to integrate fully with standard g-code.
